Connect your HarmonyOS device to your tailnet. Reach your computers and NAS, move files between devices, and open your remote media library.

## Features

1. **Private networking:** connect to Tailscale, inspect device status and latency, and access services by Tailscale IP.
2. **Exit nodes and subnet routes:** use an available exit node, accept approved routes, and control local network access.
3. **File sharing:** send and receive files with Taildrop through MeshSend; browse, upload and download authorized Taildrive shares.
4. **Media integration:** discover Jellyfin, Emby and Plex servers and open them in HosPlayer.
5. **Local privacy:** protect app access and Taildrive folders with system authentication.
6. **Native experience:** adaptive ArkUI layouts, light and dark themes, and English and Chinese app interfaces.

## Compatibility

The source project targets **HarmonyOS 6.1 / API 23** and **arm64**, with layouts for phones, tablets and 2in1 devices. Check AppGallery for the requirements of the store version. Device testing has primarily used a physical phone.

The Tailscale engine is currently pinned to **1.86.5** with the OpenHarmony Go 1.24 toolchain.
